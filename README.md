# 🐍 Python Practice

This repository contains my first Python projects while preparing for JEE and building my foundation for **Vylvo**, my future software development company.

## 📘 About
I'm currently learning Python, C, and other programming fundamentals.  
Here I upload small coding projects, experiments, and scripts I build while improving my logic and programming skills.

## 🧠 What’s Inside
- Simple Python scripts (loops, conditionals, functions)
- Beginner projects like calculators, games, and file tools
- Experiments with problem-solving and algorithms

## 🚀 Vision
This is my starting point for becoming a **software engineer and founder**.  
Every file here is a small step toward **Vylvo OS** and future innovations.
